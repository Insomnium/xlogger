1. Think of JdbcTemplate DAO reimplementation
2. Add author id's to topic and message tables!!! :)

EXTRA: Partial second-level cache implementation

DONE: Fix disappearing nickname and logout link from non-wall pages
DONE: Add more styles (wall topics separation)

DONE: Accomplish commenting from wall implementation
DONE: Add 'replyTo' field to message table. So there will be 2 identifiers: topicId and replyTo (message relative). Both
    are nullable.
